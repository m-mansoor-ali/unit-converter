# Unit Converter

Unit Converter is a really usefull app that lets you easily convert from various units into lots of others.

An **offline-first** progressive web application (**PWA**) that I am developing as a hobby project in order to learn and implement new web dev concepts such as **service workers**, **PRPL** pattern, and the **app shell** model.

Developed using [Polymer](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer)
